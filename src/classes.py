    b) Red --> Last Chance Dice.
2) Money --> With the Attributes of Cash and Currency.
3) Card --> This object simulates handheld cards in the board game.
    a) PropertyCards --> This object Simulates Property cards.
    b) Chance and Community Chest.
4) Property --> This are the Streets from Monopoly.
5) Board --> This is where the Game is Running.
    a) Space --> This is where Properties are located on the board.
