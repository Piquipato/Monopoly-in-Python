  - Making the Program gather statistical data about the games being simulated.
  - Making it Playable by Humans too (after achieving the rest of the goals):
    - Local Games
    - Multiplayer Games 
  - Making it cross-plataform:
    - PC - Main Plataform
    - Smartphones and Tablets - Android, iOS, Windows Phone...

    - Original Rules
    - Betting for Streets
    - Insane Lotteries
  - Advanced Property Trading Plataform - Plataform to trade properties with other players:
    - Money
    - Streets
    - Loans
